# jesEcom Open-Source E-commerce Solution

jesEcom (Originally jesEcom New York) was a New York-based fashion retail startup that served consumers in South Asian countries to shop from luxury western brands.

Upon its demise due to logistical complications, the tech platform that powered jesEcom was open-sourced as a 100% customizable framework under the MIT License.

It is developed and maintained by [Qarece New York](https://qarece.com), which shares some of the same co-founders. :heart:

## Few Things Under The Hood :eyes:

### Built using the MEVN Stack & The Usual Suspects
MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, Node.js, Mongoose ORM, Redis, Sendgrid, Nodemailer (for fallback), Stripe.

### Performant & Secure - cause we like it that way
* Distributed requests utilizing all system cores, 
* Encrypted authentication and sessions, 
* Backend equipped with request rate limiting to prevent scripted attacks and bot crawling, 
* Database & file-based logging.

### Built for the Cloud, with developers in mind
* CD/CI friendly codebase and configuration setup, 
* Simplified dev-prod and local-cloud switches, 
* Docker scripts, 
* AWS S3 Integration for cheap image storage.

### Granular controls
* Drag-and-drop design builders for home page customizations, 
* Image Editor to edit and preview product images and thumbnails, 
* Order tracking at a line item level, 
* Tariff support for international shipments, 
* Payment accepted in multiple digital forms and currencies powered by Stripe.
